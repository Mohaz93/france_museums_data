# Museum Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project aims to analyze museum data in France using Python and JupyterLab. The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from [data.gouv.fr](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/liste-et-localisation-des-musees-de-france/), which provides a comprehensive list and location of museums in France.

The project involves the following steps:

1. Loading the museum dataset from a CSV file.
2. Exploring the data by checking the available columns and their information.
3. Performing descriptive statistics on the dataset.
4. Visualizing the data using graphs and maps.

The goal of this project is to gain insights into the distribution of museums across different regions in France and provide interactive visualizations for better understanding.

## Source of Data

The museum dataset used in this project is obtained from [data.gouv.fr](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/liste-et-localisation-des-musees-de-france/), which is an open platform for sharing public data in France. The platform is developed by Etalab, a mission placed under the authority of the French Prime Minister.

[data.gouv.fr](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/liste-et-localisation-des-musees-de-france/) offers a wide range of datasets, including governmental, statistical, and geographic data, with the aim of promoting transparency and facilitating the use of public information.

By leveraging the museum dataset provided by data.gouv.fr, we can analyze and visualize the distribution and characteristics of museums in France, enabling us to gain valuable insights into the cultural landscape of the country.
